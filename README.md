Hi, this is a basic menu application. It is responsive meaning that you could view it anywhere, your phone, laptop, ipad, and even on the tv!
This application is deployed so you don't have to run anything.
The techs that were used were Pocketbase(backend), and next.js(front end)
I incorporated a lot of SSR so that the load times would be faster for visitors and their devices don't have to suffer loading pages. 
Thank you for visiting!
